# MODISTA 
MODISTA is an app designed to assist customers in purchasing the right outfit. Our app provides information on products for sale and personalized recommendations to each customer. Our app can analyze each customer's fashion preferences, including style, color, and budget. Each outfit recommendation is carefully crafted, including a combination of clothes, accessories, and shoes that match the user's preferences. 

Based on a survey conducted by our team on existing fashion apps, it was found that the applications only provide information on products sold and none of them have an outfit recommendation feature. In addition, several problems were found. How does our app help customers find the right outfit? What makes our app better in terms of user experience in shopping compared to existing apps? So this problem is the reason we want to develop this application.
